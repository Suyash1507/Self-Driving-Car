# Self-Driving-Car
This was my AI project on self driving cars, it is basically a simulation of how the car learns to travel in a path.
The main objective of this project is to design a self drive car software which could be integrated to hardware for real time applications in the future. However due to the unavailability of resources and the course syllabus we would be sticking on to
just the software part.Our first focus would be on developing an intelligent code which will be able to figure out the shortest distance between any two given points
A and B.The next hurdle we face would be to make sure that the object used to depict the car does not crash into the obstacles provided by us as the input. Finally
all this will have to be graphically depicted as we do not have the resources and knowledge to implement in the hardware scale. Once itâ€™s all done, we can focus on making the system more reliable and feature rich like for example the speed adjustment based on the limits ahead or the choosing of different routes to the
destination based on traffic etc.
You need to download all the packages that are required in this project and then run the file pycar.py
